## Usage
Mining functional dependencies from database raw data, with TANE and DFD, two algorithms included.

### TANE
In **main.cpp**, change

	TANE("input file path")

to your own absolute path.

### DFD 

## Test Result of TANE
|data size|searching time|  
|-|-|  
|100,000|4.5s|
## Test Result of DFD 
|data size|searching time|  
|-|-|  
|100,000|10.57s|
